    <h1>The History of Nigeria Since 1960</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Independence and the First Republic (1960-1966)</h2>
        <p>On October 1, 1960, Nigeria gained independence from British colonial rule. The newly independent nation adopted a federal constitution, with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa becoming the first Prime Minister. Nigeria became a republic in 1963, and Nnamdi Azikiwe became the first President.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Military Rule and Civil War (1966-1979)</h2>
        <p>The First Republic was short-lived, as a military coup in 1966 led to the assassination of many political leaders, including Prime Minister Balewa. The Eastern region, led by Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, declared independence as the Republic of Biafra in 1967, resulting in the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970). The war ended in 1970 with Biafra's defeat.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Second Republic and Further Military Rule (1979-1999)</h2>
        <p>In 1979, Nigeria transitioned back to civilian rule with the election of Shehu Shagari. However, another military coup in 1983 led by General Muhammadu Buhari ended the Second Republic. A series of military governments followed, including the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida and the controversial annulment of the 1993 presidential election, which was widely believed to have been won by Moshood Abiola.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Return to Democracy (1999-Present)</h2>
        <p>In 1999, Nigeria returned to democratic governance with the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as President. Since then, Nigeria has experienced multiple peaceful transitions of power, with notable presidents including Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, Goodluck Jonathan, and Muhammadu Buhari. The country continues to grapple with economic challenges, ethnic tensions, and the fight against terrorism, but remains Africa's most populous nation and largest economy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has faced numerous political and social challenges. From military coups to civil war and the return to democracy, the nation's resilience and potential for growth continue to shape its path forward. Nigeria's history is one of complexity and diversity, much like the country itself.</p>
